## Introduction & Problem Definition
- The sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912 is perhaps the most infamous maritime disaster, with over 1,500 passengers and staff dying in the disaster. Hence, we wanted to find out:
1. What are the main factors contributing to whether one survives or not;
2. Whether one of us, Jun Han, would be able to survive if he were onboard the Titanic.

## Code

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
-	KNN
-	Logistic Regression
-	Naive Bayes
-	Stochastic Gradient Decent
-	Linear SVC
-	Perceptron	

## Insights & Conclusion
- The age, gender and fare paid by a passenger are the most important factors determining survivability onboard.
- Jun Han would unfortunately not survive if he were onboard the Titanic. However, if he were to be female, he would have survived.

## Learning Points
- Feature engineering in Data Cleaning to extract only the crucial information
